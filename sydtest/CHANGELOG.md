# Changelog

## [0.15.1.2] - 2024-07-18

* Fix parsing filter flags so it becomes easy to select tests with spaces in their description

## [0.15.1.1] - 2023-10-04

* Compatibility with `optparse-applicative > 0.18`.
* Compatibility with `GHC >= 9.7`.
* Refactored out `fast-myers-diff` into its own package.

## [0.15.1.0] - 2023-07-28

* `setupAroundWithAll`: so it's easier to use multiple outer resources to provide an inner resource, without the need of extra type annotation.

## [0.15.0.0] - 2023-04-08

* `DefBeforeAllWithNode`: so that `beforeAllWith` can be defined in terms of it and have better parallelism properties.
* `DefSetupNode`: so that `beforeAll_` can be defined in terms of it and have better parallelism properties.

## [0.14.0.0] - 2023-04-05

* Profiling mode, for figuring out why your test suite is slow.
  Use `--profile` to turn it on.
* An improved asynchronous test runner.
* Made `--debug` imply `--retries 0`

## [0.13.0.4] - 2023-03-31

### Added

* Allow supplying multiple `--filter`/`--match` flags.
* Add short names `-m` and `-f` for the filter flag options.

## [0.13.0.3] - 2023-03-27

### Added

* Compatibility with `mtl-2.3`

## [0.13.0.2] - 2023-03-24

### Changed

* Improved white space diffing

## [0.13.0.1] - 2023-01-13

### Changed

* Replaced the diffing algorithm by a custom one.
  This has sped up diffing at least 100x and let us get rid of the `Diff` and `split` dependencies.
* Reworded 'likely not flaky' to 'does not look flaky' to be more technically
  accurate as we know nothing about the likelihood of flakiness.

## [0.13.0.0] - 2022-10-14

### Changed

* Changed the default of --golden-start to false.
  If this causes any of your tests to fail, that means that you are not
  correctly shipping the golden results along with your test suite.
* Fixed a typo in the parallelisation warning that you see when you run sydtest in parallel with only one core..

## [0.12.0.1] - 2022-10-06

* Released the changelog with a date.

## [0.12.0.0] - 2022-10-06

### Added

* Automatic flakiness diagnostics, see the `README`
  This adds the `potentiallyFlaky` and `potentiallyFlakyWith` functions.
* `Test.Syd` now also exports `pPrint`.
* The `modifyRetries`, `withoutRetries`, `withRetries` functions, to allow configuration of the number of retries independently of whether flakiness is allowed.
* The `TestRunReport` type, so that a `ResultForest` contains information about all runs of a test instead of only the last.
* Expectation of failure.
  This adds the `expectFailing`, `expectPassing`, and `withExpectationMode` functions.

### Changed

* Fixed: Fail-fast now works correctly together with fail-on-flaky
* Fixed that flags with a `no-` prefix did not parse correctly and could therefore not be used.
* The `FlakinessMode` type no longer contains a number of retries.
  The number of retries is now configured separately.
* Fixed that `xdescribe` would only result in one pending test instead of the same number of tests as are marked as pending.
* Fixed that `specify` and `prop` would show a callstack from inside `sydtest` instead of from where you used them.
* Sydtest now sets the global pseudorandomness seed in the random library to the given seed using `setStdGen` for extra reproducability.

### Removed

## [0.11.0.2] - 2022-09-7

### Changed

* Added the `shouldMatchList` expectation, corresponding the one from
  `hspec-expectations`.

## [0.11.0.1] - 2022-06-28

### Changed

* Made the type of `setupAround` more general.

## [0.11.0.0] - 2022-06-28

### Changed

* `printOutputSpecForest` now uses `Data.Text.Lazy.IO` to output the report, so it will try to respect the system's locale.
* `renderResultReport` now outputs a `Text.Builder` instead of a `ByteString.Builder` and a newline at the end.

## [0.10.1.0] - 2022-06-04

### Changed

* Fixed a bug where multiple layers of contextual failures were not unwrapped and shown correctly.
* Made 'Assertion' fields strict.

## [0.10.0.0] - 2022-04-28

### Added

* Allow supplying filters without a flag, so `hello` instead of `--filter hello` or `--match hello`.
* Simplified the way exceptions work to allow for attaching context to any failure instead of only `Assertion`s.

## [0.9.0.0] - 2022-04-13

### Added

* Optional type-safe progress reporting for property tests.

## [0.8.0.1] - 2022-02-11

### Changed

* Fixed property tests without labels still showing labels in the output.

## [0.8.0.0] - 2022-02-11

### Changed

* The `TestDefM` now contains a `TestDefEnv` which also contains the test description path, along with `TestRunSettings`.
* Removed the `MonadState ()` instance of `TestDefM`. It was just silly.
* Changed the internals of `TestDefM` to use `ReaderT` and a strict `WriterT` instead of `RWST`.
* Renamed `wrapRWST` to `wrapForest`.
* Fixed the property label output to use the right total.
* Moved `filterTestForest` and `randomiseTestForest` from `Test.Syd.TestDefM` to `Test.Syd.SpecDef`, where `SpecDefForest` is defined.

### Added

* `getTestDescriptionPath` to get the test description path upwards from inside a test definition.


## [0.7.0.1] - 2021-12-23

### Changed

* Fixed `shouldStartWith` to test on the prefix rather then infix

## [0.7.0.0] - 2021-12-15

### Added

* Flaky tests now show up in the failure report when `--fail-on-flaky` is active.
* Flakiness information like the number of retries is now shown in the failure report for real (non-flaky) failures.

### Changed

* Simplified the way settings are passed around.

## [0.6.1.0] - 2021-12-10

### Added

* The `flakyWith` combinator, which is like `flaky`, but lets you also add a message to your team.

## [0.6.0.0] - 2021-11-12

### Changed

* Started using `autodocodec` instead of `yamlparse-applicative`.

## [0.5.0.0] - 2021-11-12

### Added

* The flakiness combinators (`flaky`, `notFlaky`, and `withFlakiness`) to mark a test group as potentially flaky.
* The `--fail-on-flaky` flag to falsify flakiness.
* Experimental Windows support

### Changed

* Fixed the interpretation of `max-size` vs `max-success` in the configuration file and environment parsing.

## [0.4.1.0] - 2021-10-10

### Added

* The `--random-seed` option to use random seeds instead of the fixed seed that is used by default.

## [0.4.0.0] - 2021-09-02

### Added

* The `--debug` option.

### Changed

* Redid the entire flags parsing.
  This should be backward compatible, and result in a nicer `--help` overview.

## [0.3.0.3] - 2021-08-07

### Changed

* Show the total number of examples in the output as well

## [0.3.0.2] - 2021-07-06

### Changed

* Accept options using American spelling as well.

## [0.3.0.1] - 2021-06-20

### Changed

* Turned off shrinking when using `around` and friends. See https://github.com/nick8325/quickcheck/issues/331.

## [0.3.0.0] - 2021-06-17

### Added

* An `IsTest (ReaderT env IO a)` instance.

### Deleted

* `Test.Syd.Def.Env`, which contained `eit` and `withTestEnv`
  Now that `ReaderT env IO a` is also in `IsTest`, you can just use `it` for this.

## [0.2.0.0] - 2021-06-03

### Added

* `beforeWith` and `beforeWith'`
* `scenarioDir` and `scenarioDirRecur` for scenario testing.
* `bracketSetupFunc`

### Changed

* The `SetupFunc` has been simplified to only take one type parameter.

### Deleted

* `composeSetupFunc`, now obsolete: use `<=<` instead.
* `connectSetupFunc`, now obsolete: use `>=>` instead.
* `wrapSetupFunc`, now entirely obsolete.
* `unwrapSetupFunc`, now entirely obsolete.
* `makeSimpleSetupFunc`, now obsolete: Use the `SetupFunc` constructor directly.
* `useSimpleSetupFunc`, now obsolete: Use the `unSetupFunc` function directly.
